# Shellbox

A small framework for organizing Zsh aliases, functions, and scripts into
domains.

It uses regular shell files and one small loader, so the whole setup is easy to
inspect.

## How it works

```text
.zshrc -> setup/init -> domains -> aliases + functions + scripts
```

`setup.sh` adds one source line to `.zshrc`. The init script then:

- sources aliases and functions;
- links scripts into `bin/`; and
- adds `bin/` to `PATH`.

That is the whole mechanism. There is no plugin manager or manifest.

## Domains

Shellbox has two domain directories:

- `domains/` contains local helpers and is ignored by Git.
- `example-domains/` contains the helpers I use on my machines.

Only `domains/` is loaded by default. With `--with-examples`, the example
domains load first and the local domains load afterward.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tridimensionaal/shellbox.git "$HOME/.shellbox"
cd "$HOME/.shellbox"
./setup.sh
```

Setup creates `domains/` and adds this block to `.zshrc`:

```zsh
# ---start_of_shellbox_setup---
# managed by Shellbox (do not edit inside this block)
source "/path/to/shellbox/setup/init" --domains-only
# ---end_of_shellbox_setup---
```

Open a new shell after setup.

To also load `example-domains/`:

```sh
./setup.sh --with-examples
```

Running setup again switches between the two modes without adding another
block.

## Create a domain

A domain is just a directory:

```text
domains/docker/
├── aliases
├── functions/
│   └── dclean
└── scripts/
    └── docker-summary
```

`aliases` contains normal alias definitions:

```zsh
alias dps='docker ps'
```

Files under `functions/` have a shebang and define a function:

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

dclean() {
    docker container prune
}
```

Files under `scripts/` are standalone scripts with a shebang. Their filenames
become commands on `PATH`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker system df
```

No registration is needed. Open a new shell and the domain is loaded.

An example domain can also be copied as a starting point:

```sh
cp -R example-domains/git domains/git
```

The included domains cover files, Git, grep, navigation, Python, and tmux. See
[example-domains/README.md](./example-domains/README.md) for the commands and
requirements.

## Keep local domains in Git

`domains/` is ignored by the main repo. It can be its own Git repository:

```sh
git -C domains init
git -C domains add .
git -C domains commit -m "Add my shell domains"
```

Since `domains/` is ignored, deleting the Shellbox directory also deletes those
local files unless they are stored somewhere else.

## Other setup options

```sh
./setup.sh --dry-run
./setup.sh --rc-file "$HOME/.zshrc"
./setup.sh --shell bash
```

If you are unsure how to use `setup.sh`, run `./setup.sh --help` to see the
available options.

Zsh uses `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc` by default. Bash support is kept where it
stays simple, but Zsh is the main target.

## Upgrading from the old layout

The old version loaded helpers from `modules/`. Run
`./setup.sh --with-examples` to keep loading the included helpers, then move any
personal domains left in `modules/` into `domains/`.

Old generated script links are cleaned the next time Shellbox loads.
