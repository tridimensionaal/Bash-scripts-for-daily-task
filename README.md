# Bash scripts for daily tasks

Small, focused bash scripts for common workflows.

---

## Setup
Use `link-bin` to symlink all scripts under `scripts/` into `~/bin`:

```sh
./link-bin
```

Make sure `~/bin` is in your PATH (via `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

## Modules

Scripts, functions and aliases are grouped by task/domain on the modules folder. For more details about the current modules see [modules/README.md](./modules/README.md) for more details.
